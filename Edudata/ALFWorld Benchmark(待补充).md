**ALFWorld** contains interactive TextWorld environments (Côté et. al) that parallel embodied worlds in the ALFRED dataset (Shridhar et. al). The aligned environments allow agents to reason and learn high-level policies in an abstract space before solving embodied tasks through low-level actuation.
